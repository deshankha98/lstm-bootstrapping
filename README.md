# lstm-bootstrapping
Contains the successful codes and some trial ones on our project. In this project a novel bootstrap procedure is proposed using deep learning based technique. 
LSTMs were trained on bootstrapped logged return values on the closing prices of a stock and predicted values are used to create percentile based 95% confidence intervals. 
A novel benchmark is proposed to compare different confidence interval based strategies.
A novel optimum block length selection method is also discussed and 3 kinds of bootstrapping are done on the logged return series.
