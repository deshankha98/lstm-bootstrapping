# lstm-bootstrapping
Contains the successful codes and some trial ones on my project. In the project LSTMs were trained on bootstrapped logged return values on the closing prices of a stock and predicted values are used to create percentile based 95% confidence intervals. A novel optimum block length selection method is also discussed and 3 kinds of bootstrapping are done on the logged return series.
